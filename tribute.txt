             About Kalpana Chawla
            </h1>
 
             
 
<p>
                <li>Kalpana Chawla was born on 17 March 1962 in Karnal, Haryan.</li>
                <li>She completed her schooling from Tagore Baal Niketan Senior Secondary School, Karnal. She went to local flying clubs and watched planes with her father.</li>
                <li>Her date of birth was falsified by her family to 1 July 1961, to allow her to become eligible for the matriculation exam. After getting a<em> Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, India,</em>she moved to the United States in 1982 and <strong>obtained a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984.</strong></li>
                <li>Chawla went on to earn a second Masters in 1986 and a PhD in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University of Colorado Boulder.</li>
                <li>In 1988, Chawla began working at NASA Ames Research Center, where she did computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research on vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) concepts. Much of Chawla's research is included in technical journals and conference papers. In 1993, she joined Overset Methods, Inc.<strong> as Vice president and Research Scientist</strong> specializing in simulation of moving multiple body problems.</li>
                <li>Chawla held a Certificated Flight Instructor rating for airplanes, gliders and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes and gliders. After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1991, Chawla applied for the NASA Astronaut Corps.She joined the corps in March 1995 and was selected <strong>for her first flight in 1997</strong>.</li>
                <li>Her first space mission began on 19 November 1997, as part of the <strong>six-astronaut</strong> crew that flew the Space <strong>Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87.</strong></li> 
                <li>Chawla was the first Indian woman to go in space. She spoke the following words while traveling in the<strong> weightlessness of space, "You are just your intelligence." She had traveled 10.67 million km, as many as 252 times around the Earth.</strong></li>
                <li>On her first mission, Chawla traveled 10.4/6.5 million miles in 252 orbits of the earth, logging more than 376 hours (15 days and 16 hours) in space.During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying the Spartan Satellite which malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Takao Doi to capture the satellite.</li>
                    <li>A five-month NASA investigation exonerated[citation needed] Chawla by identifying errors in software interfaces and the defined procedures of the flight crew and ground control.</li>
                    <li>After the completion of STS-87 post-flight activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the astronaut office to work on the space station.</li>
                <li><strong>Chawla died on 1 February 2003, in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster</strong>, along with the other six crew members, when Columbia disintegrated over Texas during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, shortly before it was scheduled to conclude its 28th mission, STS-107.</li>
                <li>Her remains were identified along with those of the rest of the crew members and were cremated and scattered at Zion National Park in Utah in accordance with her wishes.</li>
